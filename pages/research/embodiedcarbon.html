        <p class="project__header">Embodied Carbon Tool</p>
        <p class="project__text">As part of a freelance internship at Starr Whitehouse, I developed a tool that allows users to analyze embodied carbon metrics in real-time. After parsing a Rhino file into its component materials, this Grasshopper script displays both overall embodied carbon totals for the project as well as totals separated out by material. Carbon coefficients from the <a class="content__links" href="http://epicdatabase.com.au/">EPiC database</a> inform the calculation of the final values. These figures are exportable for further analysis outside of Grasshopper in a variety of data formats, including CSV.
            <br>
            <br>
            The goal of this tool is to allow designers to quickly understand the long-term embodied carbon impact of a built project. While the specific prototype focused on analyzing completed projects for post-construction takeaways, earlier application of this tool in the design process would be useful for internal sustainability reviews.
