        <p class="project__text">
            In February 2004, the MTA re-opened the north tracks of the Manhattan Bridge with new service patterns. This resulted in the ability to have a one-seat express ride from Chinatown in Manhattan to the Southern Brooklyn
neighborhoods of Sunset Park, Bensonhurst, and Dyker
Heights. In the decades since this service change, we
have observed a fraying of the once-clustered Chinatown
in Manhattan and the development of ethnic enclaves in
Southern Brooklyn.
            <br>
            <br>
            Together with my teammates <a class="content__links" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-b-abdallah-42813314a/">Sarah Abdallah</a> and <a class="content__links" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zoelin1122/">Zoe Lin</a>, we identified clusters, compared similarity indices, and created a multi-modal service area to test how this transit development affected the Chinatown community. We then ran 
            a variety of metrics to understand the effects of this transit change over time. The results paint a
            complicated picture on how various
            measurements of life in the city have
            affected the ethnic enclave near the foot
            of the Manhattan Bridge. The new train patterns are clearly servicing
            a greatly different Lower Manhattan,
            one with higher property values, greater
            connectivity to the city, and lower
            percentage of immigrant residents.
