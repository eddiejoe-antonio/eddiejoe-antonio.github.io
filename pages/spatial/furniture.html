        <p class="project__text">I have designed, built, and assembled furniture for personal, academic, and commercial use. I began this interest at the <a class="content__links" href="https://berkeley.yalecollege.yale.edu/student-life/berkeley-woodshop">Berkeley College Woodshop</a> at Yale University, where I built my first coffee table. I then spent a year apprenticing as a furniture designer at <a class="content__links" href="https://gloriacortina.com/">Gloria Cortina Studio</a> in Mexico City, where I spent time both in a traditional design office and in the workshops of artisans around the city. While working with Gloria Cortina, I helped develop an archive of digital models, sections, detailed plans, and other drawings of their commonly sold pieces. I also assisted in the design of an exhibit at <a class="content__links" href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/8-salon-art-design-2019-standouts">Salon 2019</a> in New Yorkâ€™s Park Avenue Armory. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I have since built much of my personal furniture for my living space and supported a friend who developed an Etsy business with some part-time woodworking.
